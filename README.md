# Project Issues 

CSS3:
When styling my CSS3 page, I frequently had difficulties imagining where everything was being situated at or what commands I needed to implement in order to control the layout of my web page. A solution that I used in order to solve this was creating a 'loud' outline so that I could visually see the borders on my browser.

JavaScript/jQuery:
The biggest challenges I encountered during this project was being able to begin the project soley by my own doing. However, looking back at previous labs did allow me to begin creating a framework of what I envisioned for my project.  In addition, I found it particularly difficult to render certain informations onto the browser. Particularly when the information was nested within an array. I often found myself plugging different variables in various locations in order to display the objects onto the screen. Needless to say, Project 1 had a decent amount of trial by error situations. 


## Future Enhancements:
For future modifications, I would like to focus on improving user experiences by adding a more specific navigation system in order to make the application more readable and more user-friendly.  In addition, I would like to optimize my browser for mobile users to make the application more accessible for everyone.
