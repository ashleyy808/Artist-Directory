# Project Issues

Index.HTML:
While they are easily solved problems, due to the unfamiliarity of certain coding stuctures, I often found myself having difficulties when setting up certain tags in the index.HTML. There were multiple occasions where I had to continuosly look up what certain tags and their purpose when trying to put content on my browser page.

CSS3:
When styling my CSS3 page, I frequently had difficulties imagining where everything was being situated at, and what commands to implement in order to control the layout on my web page. A solution that I used was creating a 'loud' outline so that I could visually see my content borders.

JavaScript/jQuery:
The biggest challenges I encountered during this project was being able to begin the project soley by my own doing. I would say that looking back at previous labs did allow me to begin thinking logically on what I want my project to do.  In addition, I found it particularly difficult to render certain informations onto the browser. Particularly when the information was nested within an array. I often found myself plugging different variables in various locations in order to display the objects onto the screen. Needless to say, Project 1 had a decent amount of trial by error situations.
